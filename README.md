# PID-Control-for-a-Manipulator-Robot

## Abstract
In this work, we proposed a PID controller for a single robotic arm joint. It will help to simplify mechatronics motion control system design. This work proposes mathematical modeling, simulation and control of a given electric motor in terms of input volt, Vin and output motions. This model can be used to select, design, test and validate both plants and motion control design to meet desired output performance.

## Conclusion
In this study, mathematical modeling is done for the manipulator robot using physical governing equations on the system. After obtaining the block diagram for the system the analysis was done on the system. 
</br>
From the time-domain analysis and frequency domain analysis, it is found that the system is stable. To improve the results, a controller with Kp is designed, it was observed that settling time and overshoot were reduced. Then the PID controller was designed and observed. It showed better results than the P controller.
</br>
From all the observations it can be inferred that the best performance is for the PID controller since it satisfies all of the desired specifications the best and decreases settling time significantly

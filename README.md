# PID-Control-for-a-Manipulator-Robot

In this work, we proposed a PID controller for a single robotic arm joint. It will help to simplify mechatronics motion control system design. This work proposes mathematical modeling, simulation and control of a given electric motor in terms of input volt, Vin and output motions. This model can be used to select, design, test and validate both plants and motion control design to meet desired output performance.
